A.I for a game of tic tac toe.

How to play:::
'new' or 'new 1p' to start new single player game.
'new 2p' to start a two player game

set p1/p2/ai name/sign "..." to set the value of player1/player2/ai name to desired value.

'view score/settings/help/credits' to view them.

exit to exit the game
 
help and credits sections are still under construction and so is the game menu.

Compile all the files except for alternateAi.c.

alternateAi.c is a single file version of the game use it if you have trouble compiling multiple files.

Still need to add comments.
